# Sprint Change Proposal: Defer Deployment to Post-MVP

## Analysis Summary

**Issue:** Complex AWS infrastructure deployment planned in Epic 1 creates unnecessary complexity that blocks rapid MVP validation and development iteration.

**Impact:** 40-50% of initial development effort focused on infrastructure rather than core product functionality. AWS setup (ECS Fargate, VPC, ALB, CloudFront) is premature optimization before product-market validation.

**Rationale:** Local development enables faster iteration cycles, immediate testing, and validates core story generation concept before infrastructure investment. Zero impact on user-facing functionality.

## Epic Impact Summary

- **Epic 1:** Simplified - removes AWS deployment, maintains all core functionality
- **Epics 2-4:** No changes - completely unaffected
- **New Epic 5:** Post-MVP deployment and production infrastructure

## Specific Proposed Edits

### 1. Story 1.1 Acceptance Criteria Changes

**REMOVE:**
```
6. Development, staging, and production environments configured on AWS
```

**ADD:**
```
6. Local development environment with Docker Compose for backend services
7. Simple local deployment documentation for development and testing
```

### 2. PRD Timeline Update

**FROM:**
```
### 16-Week Implementation Plan
- Month 1: Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- Month 2: Epic 2 - Story Generation & Safety
- Month 3: Epic 3 - Personalization & User Experience
- Month 4: Epic 4 - Story Management & Persistence
```

**TO:**
```
### 12-Week MVP + 4-Week Deployment Plan
- Month 1: Epic 1 - Foundation (Local Development)
- Month 2: Epic 2 - Story Generation & Safety
- Month 3: Epic 3 - Personalization & User Experience
- Month 4: Epic 4 - Story Management & Persistence
- **MVP VALIDATION PERIOD** (2-4 weeks user testing)
- Month 5: Epic 5 - Production Infrastructure & Deployment
```

### 3. New Epic 5 Addition

**ADD to PRD Epic List:**
```
**Epic 5: Production Infrastructure & Deployment**
*Deploy validated MVP to production AWS infrastructure with full monitoring, security, and scalability features*
```

### 4. Architecture Overview Update

**UPDATE Development Timeline section to:**
```
### 12-Week MVP Development Plan
- **Month 1:** Epic 1 - Foundation (Local Development Focus)
- **Month 2:** Epic 2 - Story Generation & Safety
- **Month 3:** Epic 3 - Personalization & User Experience
- **Month 4:** Epic 4 - Story Management & Persistence
- **Month 5:** Epic 5 - Production Deployment (Post-MVP Validation)
```

## Recommended Path Forward

**Direct Adjustment** - Modify existing documentation to support local-first development approach while preserving all planned functionality. Zero work discarded, accelerated MVP timeline by 3-4 weeks.

## High-Level Action Plan

1. Update Story 1.1 acceptance criteria for local development
2. Modify PRD timeline to reflect MVP-first approach  
3. Add Epic 5 for post-MVP deployment phase
4. Update architecture documentation for local development focus
5. Defer infrastructure.md implementation to Epic 5 planning phase

## Agent Handoff Plan

- **Scrum Master (Current):** Complete documentation updates
- **Developer Agent:** Implement simplified Story 1.1 with local deployment focus
- **Infrastructure Specialist:** Available for Epic 5 planning post-MVP validation

---

**Status:** Ready for implementation  
**Next Steps:** Execute proposed documentation changes  
**Timeline Impact:** Accelerates MVP delivery by 3-4 weeks  
**Risk Level:** Low - simplification reduces complexity
