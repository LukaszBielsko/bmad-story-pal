# Epic 2: Story Generation & Safety

**Epic Goal:** Implement the core AI-powered story generation capabilities with comprehensive content safety systems. This epic transforms StoryMagic from a static story reader into an intelligent, personalized story creator while ensuring zero inappropriate content reaches families.

## Story 2.1: OpenAI API Integration

As the backend system,
I want to connect securely to OpenAI's API,
so that I can generate personalized stories for children.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. OpenAI API client configured with API key management
2. Story generation service module created in NestJS
3. Basic story generation endpoint with error handling
4. API rate limiting implemented to prevent quota exhaustion
5. Response caching strategy for similar story requests
6. API usage monitoring and logging for cost tracking

## Story 2.2: Content Safety System

As a parent,
I want absolute confidence that AI-generated stories are appropriate,
so that I never worry about harmful content during bedtime.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. OpenAI Moderation API integrated for content filtering
2. Custom safety rules implemented for child-specific content
3. Multi-layer safety validation (pre-generation prompts + post-generation filtering)
4. Inappropriate content logging system for monitoring and improvement
5. Fallback to pre-approved stories if safety checks fail
6. Zero-tolerance policy: any flagged content is immediately rejected

## Story 2.3: Story Prompt Engineering

As a child,
I want stories that are age-appropriate and engaging for my specific age group,
so that I stay interested and entertained throughout the story.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Age-specific prompt templates created for 3-4, 5-6, and 7-8 year olds
2. Story length optimization (300-500 words based on age)
3. Polish language prompts with cultural context considerations
4. Story structure templates (beginning, adventure, resolution)
5. Prompt validation system to ensure consistent story quality
6. A/B testing framework for prompt optimization

## Story 2.4: Pre-Generated Story Library

As a parent,
I want immediate access to quality stories when AI generation is slow or unavailable,
so that bedtime routines are never disrupted.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Database schema created for storing curated stories
2. 15-20 high-quality Polish stories created and safety-validated
3. Story categorization system (themes: adventure, animals, friendship, etc.)
4. Story metadata including age recommendations and reading time
5. API endpoints for retrieving stories by category and age
6. Fallback logic when AI generation fails or times out

## Story 2.5: Story Generation API

As the mobile app,
I want to request personalized stories through a reliable API,
so that parents can create custom stories for their children.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. RESTful API endpoint for story generation requests
2. Input validation for story parameters (age, theme, basic details)
3. Asynchronous processing with status polling for longer generations
4. Story response format standardized with metadata
5. Error handling with meaningful messages for mobile app
6. Performance monitoring to ensure 30-second generation time limit
