# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

StoryMagic's interface embodies "Evening Sanctuary Design" - a calming, intuitive experience optimized for cognitively depleted parents during bedtime routines. The design prioritizes speed, simplicity, and reliability over sophisticated features, ensuring parents can successfully create engaging stories without mental strain.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Three-Tap Flow:** Maximum three taps to generate a complete story, minimizing decision fatigue
- **Instant Visual Feedback:** Immediate confirmation of selections to reduce anxiety about progress
- **One-Handed Operation:** All primary actions accessible with thumb navigation for parents holding children
- **Error-Proof Design:** Large touch targets and clear visual hierarchy prevent accidental inputs

## Core Screens and Views

- **Welcome Screen:** Quick access to recent stories and simple "Create New Story" button
- **Child Profile Selection:** Visual grid of child avatars with names for instant recognition
- **Theme Selection Screen:** Large, illustrated theme cards (Adventure, Princess, Animals, etc.)
- **Personalization Screen:** Simple form with 2-3 key details (favorite color, pet, hobby)
- **Story Display Screen:** Clean text layout with large fonts, progress indicator, and save/share options
- **Story Library:** Grid view of saved stories with child's name and theme for easy identification

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Full compliance with WCAG AA standards including high contrast ratios, scalable text, and screen reader support for parents with visual impairments.

## Branding

Warm, family-friendly aesthetic with soft colors and rounded elements that feel safe and approachable. Visual design should evoke bedtime tranquility - muted blues, soft purples, and warm whites with subtle animations that feel magical but not stimulating.

## Target Device and Platforms: Mobile Only

Optimized specifically for mobile devices (iOS and Android) with responsive design for various screen sizes. No desktop or tablet-specific layouts - focus entirely on phone-based interaction patterns for parents.
