# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create personalized bedtime stories where children (ages 3-8) become protagonists of their own adventures
- Reduce cognitive load for exhausted parents during evening storytelling routines  
- Enhance family bonding time through engaging, safe, age-appropriate AI-generated narratives
- Provide reliable, quick story generation (under 30 seconds) that works consistently for bedtime routines
- Achieve 1,000 active Polish families within 6 months with 60% monthly retention rate

## Background Context

StoryMagic addresses a critical pain point for working parents in Poland: the challenge of providing engaging bedtime content when mentally exhausted from daily responsibilities. Traditional books become repetitive and fail to capture children's imagination, while generic story apps lack meaningful personalization.

The app leverages AI technology to transform children into story protagonists through a simple 3-step process (child profile → theme selection → personalization), designed specifically for evening cognitive limitations. This solution builds on proven psychology - children naturally engage more when they're the main character - while preserving the sacred tradition of family bedtime stories without adding complexity for tired parents.
