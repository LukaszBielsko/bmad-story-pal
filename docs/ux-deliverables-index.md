- **Calming Color Palette**: Soft midnight blue, warm lavender, gentle coral
- **One-Handed Optimization**: Primary actions in easy thumb reach zones
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual confirmation of all user actions

## Target Users & Context

### Primary Users: Polish Parents (Ages 28-40)
**Context**: End of workday, managing bedtime routines, cognitively depleted
**Needs**: Quick access to engaging, personalized bedtime content

### Secondary Users: Children (Ages 3-8)
**Context**: Bedtime routine, varying attention spans
**Needs**: Personalized stories where they are the protagonist

### Usage Scenario: Bedtime Routine
- **Time Pressure**: 15-30 minute bedtime window
- **Cognitive State**: Parents mentally exhausted from day
- **Physical Constraints**: Often holding children, one-handed operation
- **Environmental**: Dim lighting, need for calm atmosphere

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native with TypeScript
- **Backend**: NestJS monolithic API with modular structure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSON support for story content
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API with content safety filtering
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth for family account management

### Performance Requirements
- **Story Generation**: Maximum 30 seconds
- **App Load Time**: Under 3 seconds
- **Offline Support**: Previously saved stories available without internet
- **Cross-Platform**: iOS and Android with consistent experience
