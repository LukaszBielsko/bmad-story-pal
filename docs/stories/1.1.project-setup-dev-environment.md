# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Development Environment

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish the complete development environment and project structure,
**so that** I can efficiently build and deploy the StoryMagic application.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React Native monorepo initialized with TypeScript configuration
2. NestJS backend API created with modular folder structure
3. Shared TypeScript types package configured between frontend and backend
4. ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks established
5. GitHub repository created with CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
6. Development, staging, and production environments configured on AWS

## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack Context
- **Frontend**: React Native with TypeScript
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cloud**: AWS
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth

### Monorepo Structure
This story establishes the foundation monorepo structure that will house:
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Backend API (NestJS)
- Shared types package
- Shared utilities

### Development Workflow
The setup should enable:
- Type safety across frontend/backend
- Consistent code formatting and linting
- Automated testing and deployment
- Environment-specific configurations

### Testing
- **Test Location**: Tests should be co-located with source files using `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extensions
- **Testing Frameworks**: 
  - Jest for unit testing (both frontend and backend)
  - React Native Testing Library for component testing
  - Supertest for API testing in NestJS
- **Test Standards**: Minimum 80% code coverage required
- **Testing Requirements**: All CI/CD pipeline steps must include automated testing
