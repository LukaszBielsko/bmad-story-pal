# Story 1.3a: Basic App Infrastructure

## Status
Completed - Ready for QA

## Story

**As a** developer preparing the mobile app foundation,
**I want** to establish stable app infrastructure and navigation,
**so that** the app can build successfully and support future feature development.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. App builds and runs successfully on both iOS and Android devices without errors
2. PostCSS configuration resolves previous async plugin errors
3. React Native navigation structure implemented and functional
4. App launches within 3 seconds on target devices (NFR2 validation)
5. No Metro bundler dependency conflicts or React version mismatches
6. Single SafeAreaProvider properly configured at app root level

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Fix PostCSS Configuration Issues (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create proper `postcss.config.js` file with TailwindCSS and Autoprefixer support
  - [x] Configure NativeWind integration correctly to avoid async plugin errors
  - [x] Test PostCSS configuration with a simple styled component
  
- [x] Task 2: Resolve Dependency Version Conflicts (AC: 1, 5)
  - [x] Update React Native to compatible version (avoid React 19 conflicts)
  - [x] Ensure Metro bundler dependencies are consistent
  - [x] Fix monorepo workspace dependency resolution
  - [x] Clean node_modules and reinstall dependencies in correct order
  
- [x] Task 3: Implement Safe Area Provider Setup (AC: 6)
  - [x] Configure single SafeAreaProvider at app root level
  - [x] Create reusable SafeAreaView component in `src/components/common/SafeAreaView.tsx`
  - [x] Avoid duplicate SafeAreaProvider instances in navigation components
  
- [x] Task 4: Create Core Navigation Structure (AC: 3)
  - [x] Implement AppNavigator.tsx as root navigation container
  - [x] Set up AuthNavigator.tsx for authentication flow (placeholder structure)
  - [x] Create basic navigation without complex screens
  - [x] Test navigation flow without circular dependencies

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Problems Analysis
**Critical Technical Issues from Story 1.3 Problems Document:**
- PostCSS async plugin configuration causing app crashes on startup
- Metro bundler dependency conflicts with mixed versions breaking builds
- React Native bridge callback errors from duplicate SafeAreaProvider components
- Monorepo React version conflicts (18.2.0 vs 19+) causing installation failures
- Component dependency chains not fully resolved leading to runtime errors

### Technical Architecture Context

#### Technology Stack Requirements [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend:** React Native 0.72+ with TypeScript
- **Navigation:** React Navigation for app flow
- **Styling:** NativeWind/TailwindCSS integration (fix PostCSS issues)
- **Build:** Metro bundler (resolve dependency conflicts)
- **Package Management:** npm workspaces for monorepo dependency management

#### Project Structure Standards [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
```
apps/mobile/src/
├── navigation/          # Navigation components
│   ├── AppNavigator.tsx
│   └── AuthNavigator.tsx
└── components/common/   # Reusable UI components
    └── SafeAreaView.tsx
```

#### Component Architecture Standards [Source: architecture/frontend.md]
- **Safe Area Management:** Single SafeAreaProvider at app root to prevent duplicate provider errors
- **Navigation Flow:** AppNavigator → AuthNavigator (basic structure)
- **Component Structure:** Props interface, hooks first, event handlers, early returns
- **Error Handling:** Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

#### Development Environment Requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode enabled, explicit typing required
- **File Naming:** PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Import Pattern:** Named imports preferred, relative imports for local files

### Critical Implementation Guidelines

1. **PostCSS Configuration** - MUST create proper `postcss.config.js` before any styling work
2. **Dependency Management** - Clean install in apps/mobile directory, avoid React 19 
3. **SafeAreaProvider** - Only ONE provider at app root, reusable wrapper component
4. **Navigation Setup** - Basic structure without complex screen implementations
5. **Metro Configuration** - Use exact versions, avoid mixed dependency versions

### File Creation Priority
1. `postcss.config.js` - Fix styling configuration first
2. `src/components/common/SafeAreaView.tsx` - Safe area wrapper component
3. `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Root navigation container
4. `src/navigation/AuthNavigator.tsx` - Authentication flow placeholder
5. `App.tsx` - Root app component with single SafeAreaProvider

### Performance Requirements
- **App Launch Time:** Must meet NFR2 requirement of <3 seconds on target devices
- **Build Performance:** Clean Metro bundling without dependency resolution delays
- **Memory Management:** Proper component cleanup and provider management

### Testing Requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Manual Testing Phase:** Component validation through direct testing
- **Build Validation:** Successful Metro bundling and app startup
- **Platform Testing:** iOS and Android compatibility verification
- **Performance Testing:** Launch time validation against NFR2

### Project Structure Notes
File paths align with defined mobile app structure. No conflicts identified between epic requirements and architecture documentation.
