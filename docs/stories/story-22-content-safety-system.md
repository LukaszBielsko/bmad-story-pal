# Story 2.2: Content Safety System

As a parent,
I want absolute confidence that AI-generated stories are appropriate,
so that I never worry about harmful content during bedtime.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. OpenAI Moderation API integrated for content filtering
2. Custom safety rules implemented for child-specific content
3. Multi-layer safety validation (pre-generation prompts + post-generation filtering)
4. Inappropriate content logging system for monitoring and improvement
5. Fallback to pre-approved stories if safety checks fail
6. Zero-tolerance policy: any flagged content is immediately rejected
