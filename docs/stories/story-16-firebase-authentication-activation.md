# Story 1.6: Firebase Authentication Activation

As a parent,
I want to use secure login flows to protect my family's data,
so that the app is ready for production use with real user accounts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React Native Firebase Auth SDK integration completed
2. Sign-up flow with email/password authentication implemented
3. Sign-in flow with error handling and validation
4. JWT token management and refresh logic implemented
5. Login/logout screens with error handling
6. Environment variable `MOCK_AUTH=false` activates full authentication
7. Seamless migration from mock mode to production authentication
