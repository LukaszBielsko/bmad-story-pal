# Story 4.1: Story Saving System

As a parent,
I want to save stories that my child loves,
so that we can read them again during future bedtime routines.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Save story button prominently displayed during story reading
2. Saved stories stored in PostgreSQL with user association
3. Story metadata preserved (title, theme, personalization details, creation date)
4. Duplicate story detection to prevent saving identical content
5. Saved story confirmation with visual feedback
6. Storage limits (50 saved stories per family) with clear messaging
