# Story 1.5: Basic Backend API

As the mobile app,
I want to communicate with a reliable backend service,
so that user data and stories can be managed securely.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. NestJS API with TypeScript running on AWS
2. PostgreSQL database connected and configured
3. Basic health check endpoint responding correctly
4. API authentication middleware using Firebase Admin SDK with environment-based mock mode (`MOCK_AUTH=true` bypasses validation)
5. CORS configuration for mobile app communication
6. Basic error handling and logging system implemented
