# Story 2.4: Pre-Generated Story Library

As a parent,
I want immediate access to quality stories when AI generation is slow or unavailable,
so that bedtime routines are never disrupted.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Database schema created for storing curated stories
2. 15-20 high-quality Polish stories created and safety-validated
3. Story categorization system (themes: adventure, animals, friendship, etc.)
4. Story metadata including age recommendations and reading time
5. API endpoints for retrieving stories by category and age
6. Fallback logic when AI generation fails or times out
