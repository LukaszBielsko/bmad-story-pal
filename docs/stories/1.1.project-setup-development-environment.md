## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Context

**Monorepo Architecture**: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#root-level-structure]
- Root structure follows npm workspace pattern with `apps/` and `packages/` directories
- Mobile app location: `apps/mobile/` with React Native + TypeScript
- Backend API location: `apps/api/` with NestJS + TypeScript  
- Shared types location: `packages/shared-types/` for cross-platform type definitions
- Build tools location: `tools/` for development and deployment scripts

**Technology Stack Requirements**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- React Native 0.72+ with TypeScript for mobile development
- NestJS backend with TypeScript and modular architecture
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Firebase Auth for user authentication
- Docker Compose for local development environment
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation

**Development Environment Setup**: [Source: architecture/development.md#development-environment-setup]
- Node.js v18+ and npm v9+ required
- Docker and Docker Compose for local services
- React Native CLI for mobile development
- Platform-specific tools: Xcode for iOS, Android Studio for Android
- PostgreSQL client (psql) for database management

### Backend Module Structure Context

**File Organization**: [Source: architecture/backend.md#module-structure]
- Source code location: `apps/api/src/`
- Module-based organization with feature folders
- Database schemas: `*.table.ts` format using Drizzle ORM
- Configuration files: `src/config/` for environment setup
- Common utilities: `src/common/` for shared guards, filters, pipes

**Database Configuration**: [Source: architecture/backend.md#drizzle-orm-configuration]  
- Database provider setup in app.module.ts with environment variables
- Schema aggregation in `src/database/schema/index.ts`
- Migration management using drizzle-kit CLI commands
- Connection pooling with Node.js pg Pool

### Frontend Structure Context

**Mobile App Organization**: [Source: architecture/frontend.md#app-structure]
- Source location: `apps/mobile/src/`
- Navigation setup with React Navigation stack/tab navigators
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Component organization by feature (auth, story, profile)
- Service layer for API communication and device integration

**Build Configuration**: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#configuration-management]
- Metro bundler configuration for React Native
- TypeScript path aliases for clean imports
- Platform-specific configurations for iOS and Android
- Development vs production environment handling

### Shared Package Architecture

**TypeScript Types Structure**: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#shared-types]
- API contract types in `src/api/` (requests/responses)
- Business domain types in `src/domain/` (User, Story, Profile)
- Common utility types in `src/common/` (Pagination, Validation)
- Package exports through index.ts barrel files

### Development Workflow Context

**Build Pipeline**: [Source: architecture/development.md#development-best-practices]
- ESLint + TypeScript strict mode for code quality
- Prettier for consistent formatting across all packages
- Husky + lint-staged for Git hooks validation
- Jest testing framework for unit and integration tests

**Environment Configuration**: [Source: architecture/development.md#development-environment-configuration]
- Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL and Redis services
- Environment-specific .env files for different stages
- AWS infrastructure for staging and production environments
- Firebase project setup for authentication services

### Project Structure Alignment Notes

All story requirements align with the defined architecture:
- Monorepo structure matches source-tree.md specifications
- Technology choices align with tech-stack.md requirements  
- Development setup follows development.md guidelines
- No conflicts identified between epic requirements and architecture

### Testing

**Testing Framework Requirements**: [Source: architecture/development.md#testing-strategy]
- Jest for unit testing (both frontend and backend)
- Supertest for API testing in NestJS
- React Native Testing Library for mobile component testing
- Minimum 80% code coverage required across all packages
- Co-located test files with source code using `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extensions

**Test Organization**:
- Backend tests: API endpoint testing, service unit tests, database integration tests
- Frontend tests: Component testing, hook testing, navigation testing
- Integration tests: Full workflow testing across mobile and API
- E2E testing setup using Detox framework for mobile app flows
