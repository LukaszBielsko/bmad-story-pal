# Story 2.5: Story Generation API

As the mobile app,
I want to request personalized stories through a reliable API,
so that parents can create custom stories for their children.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. RESTful API endpoint for story generation requests
2. Input validation for story parameters (age, theme, basic details)
3. Asynchronous processing with status polling for longer generations
4. Story response format standardized with metadata
5. Error handling with meaningful messages for mobile app
6. Performance monitoring to ensure 30-second generation time limit
