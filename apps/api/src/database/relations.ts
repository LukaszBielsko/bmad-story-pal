// Database relations - defined separately to avoid circular imports
// Import relations from drizzle-orm and define them here as features are implemented

import { relations } from 'drizzle-orm';

// Example relations structure (to be implemented as needed):
// export const userRelations = relations(users, ({ many }) => ({
//   stories: many(userStories),
// }));

// Relations will be added here as feature modules are implemented
